### freq_counter_name()
```python
freq_counter_name() -> str
```
The function returns device name.

---

### freq_counter_frequency(channel)
```python
freq_counter_frequency(channel: str) -> float
```
```
Example: freq_counter_frequency('CH1') returns the measured frequency from channel 1.
```
This function returns a floating point value with the measured frequency (in Hz) from the specified channel. Refer to the device manual for the frequency range of different channels.<br/>
Possible channels are the following: ['CH1', 'CH2', 'CH3']. Agilent 53181a has two channels; Agielnt 53131a, Keysight 53230a - three. Agielnt 5343a has only one channel.<br/>

---

### freq_counter_impedance(*impedance)
```python
freq_counter_impedance(channel: str, impedance: str) -> none
freq_counter_impedance(channel: str) -> str ['1 M', '50']
```
```
Examples: freq_counter_impedance('CH1', '1 M') sets the impedance of the channel 1 to 1 MOhm.
freq_counter_impedance('CH2') returns the current impedance of the channel 2.
```
The function queries (if called with one argument) or sets (if called with two arguments) the impedance of one of the channels of the frequency counter. If there is a second argument it will be set as a new impedance. If there is no second argument the current impedance for the specified channel is returned.<br/>
For Agilent 53181a impedance can be changed only for the first channel; for Agielnt 53131a, Keysight 53230a for channel 1 and 2.<br/>
Possible impedances are the following: ['1 M', '50'].<br/>
This function is not available for Agielnt 5343a.<br/>

---

### freq_counter_coupling(*coupling)
```python
freq_counter_coupling(channel: str, coupling: str) -> none
freq_counter_coupling(channel: str) -> str ['AC', 'DC']
```
```
Examples: freq_counter_coupling('CH1', 'AC') sets the coupling of the channel 1 to AC.
freq_counter_coupling('CH2') returns the current coupling of the channel 2.
```
The function queries (if called with one argument) or sets (if called with two arguments) the coupling of one of the channels of the frequency counter. If there is a second argument it will be set as a new coupling. If there is no second argument the current coupling for the specified channel is returned.<br/>
For Agilent 53181a coupling can be changed only for the first channel; for Agielnt 53131a, Keysight 53230a for channel 1 and 2.<br/>
Possible couplings are the following: ['1 M', '50'].<br/>
This function is not available for Agielnt 5343a.<br/>

---

### freq_counter_stop_mode(*mode)
```python
freq_counter_stop_mode(mode: str) -> none
freq_counter_stop_mode() -> str
```
```
Example: freq_counter_stop_mode('Timer') sets the digits mode.
```
This function queries or sets the stop arm for frequency, frequency ratio, and period measurements.<br/>
The mode should be from the following array: ['Immediate', 'External', 'Timer', 'Digits'] for Agilent 53181a and Agilent 53131a.<br/>
In automatic ('Immediate') mode the device does the fastest possible acquisistion, in gate time mode it measures for the specified gate time, and in digits mode the time required for a measurement depends on the number of digits requested. This setting influences the resolution of the results. Use automatic mode for fast measurements or choose a desired resolution by using [freq_counter_gate_time()](#freq_counter_gate_timetime) to set the gate time for gate time ('Timer') mode or [freq_counter_digits()](#freq_counter_digitsdigits) for digits ('Digits') mode.<br/>
For Keysight 53230a possible modes are: ['Immediate', 'Timer', 'Events'].<br/>
This function is not available for Agielnt 5343a.<br/>

---

### freq_counter_start_mode(*mode)
```python
freq_counter_start_mode(mode: str) -> none
freq_counter_start_mode() -> str ['Immediate', 'External']
```
```
Example: freq_counter_start_mode('Immediate') sets the automatic mode.
```
This function queries or sets the start arm for frequency, frequency ratio, and period measurements.<br/>
The type should be from the following array: ['Immediate', 'External'].<br/>
This function is not available for Agielnt 5343a.<br/>

---

### freq_counter_gate_mode(*mode)
```python
freq_counter_gate_mode(mode: str) -> none
freq_counter_gate_mode() -> str ['Timer', 'External']
```
```
Example: freq_counter_gate_mode('Timer') sets the 'Time' mode.
```
This function queries or sets the gate source for frequency, frequency ratio measurements.
<br/>Currently, the type should be from the following array: ['Timer', 'External'], where 'Timer' coresponds to starting the measurement immediately after a trigger and trigger delay; 'External' configures the instrument to gate the measurement using the Gate In/Out BNC after a trigger and trigger delay.<br/>
This functions is available only for Keysight 53230a.

---

### freq_counter_digits(*digits)
```python
freq_counter_digits(digits: int) -> none
freq_counter_digits() -> int
```
```
Example: freq_counter_digits(5) sets the resolution to 5 digits.
```
This function queries or sets the resolution in terms of digits used in arming frequency, period, and ratio measurements. To set this mode use [freq_counter_stop_mode()](#freq_counter_stop_modemode) function.<br/>
The argument of the function should be an integer between 3 and 15 (Agilent 53181a, 53131a,) or between 3 and 9 (Agilent 5343a). To query the number of digits call the function with no argument. A query is possible only if [freq_counter_stop_mode('Digits')](#freq_counter_stop_modemode) was called before.<br/>

sets the approximate frequency of a signal to 10 GHz.
```
The function queries (if called with one argument) or sets (if called with two arguments) the approximate frequency of a signal you expect to measure. Providing this value enables the device to eliminate a pre-measurement step, saving measurement time and enabling more accurate arming. Note that the actual frequency of the input signal must be within 10% of the expected frequency value you entered. Refer to the device manual for the frequency range of different channels.<br/>
If there is a second argument it will be set as a new approximate frequency of a signal. If there is no second argument the current approximate frequency of a signal for specified the channel is returned.<br/>
