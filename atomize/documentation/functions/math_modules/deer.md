# DEER / PDS Distance Analysis

Distance-distribution analysis for pulsed-dipolar spectroscopy (DEER/PELDOR, and
the closely related RIDME / DQC / SIFTER). All of these share one model: a
background-corrected **form factor** $F(t)$ is the integral over the distance
distribution $P(r)$ of an orientation-averaged dipolar kernel,

$$
F(t) = \int K(t, r)\,P(r)\,dr ,\qquad
K(t, r) = \int_0^1 \cos\!\big[(1 - 3\xi^2)\,\omega(r)\,t\big]\,d\xi ,
$$

with the dipolar angular frequency $\omega(r) = 2\pi\,\nu_{dd}/r^3$ (rad/µs, $r$
in nm, $t$ in µs) and $\nu_{dd} = 52.04\ \text{MHz·nm}^3$. The kernel integral
has a closed form in Fresnel integrals, so $K$ is built without a
per-orientation loop.

Recovering $P(r)$ from $F(t)$ is a Fredholm equation of the first kind
(ill-posed); this module solves it with **Tikhonov regularization +
non-negativity** (NNLS). The regularization weight $\alpha$ is chosen
automatically — by default via **generalized cross-validation (GCV)**, with the
classic **L-curve** corner also available. The background can be removed
**sequentially** (fit the tail, divide it out, invert) or fit **jointly** with
$P(r)$ in a single separable-NLLS pass (DeerLab-style).

!!! tip "Why GCV is the default"
    A DEER L-curve is nearly *vertical* — the residual stays at the noise floor
    across decades of $\alpha$ — so the Menger-curvature "corner" is ill-defined
    and tends to latch onto a tiny $\alpha$, producing a spiky comb-like $P(r)$.
    GCV has a genuine minimum and picks a stable $\alpha$, so it is used by
    default. Switch to the L-corner with `method='curvature'` if you want it.
    GCV still tends to *under*-regularize on real noisy traces; nudge it heavier
    with `alpha_factor=2..4`, or use [`deer_validate()`](#deer_validate) to average
    over background choices for a smooth consensus $P(r)$ with an uncertainty band.

!!! note "scipy is required"
    DEER analysis needs `scipy` (the `math` extra: `pip install -e .[math]`).
    scipy is imported lazily, so importing the module never fails on a minimal
    install — the routines raise a `RuntimeError` when scipy is missing.

!!! info "Conventions"
    Times are in **microseconds**, distances in **nanometres**. Internally
    $P(r)$ is handled as discrete probability masses (sum $= 1$); the matching
    density $P(r) = \text{masses}/dr$ is returned for plotting.

## deer_invert() { #deer_invert data-toc-label="deer_invert" }

```python
res = deer.deer_invert(t, V, r=None, bg_start=None, bg_end=None,
                       dim=3.0, fit_dim=False, alpha=None, alphas=None,
                       reg_order=2, nu_dd=deer.NU_DD, scan_lcurve=True,
                       method='gcv', engine='sequential', alpha_factor=1.0)
```

The full one-call pipeline: background-correct $V(t)$, build the kernel, and
invert to $P(r)$ by Tikhonov + NNLS. This is what most users want.

- **`t`, `V`** — time axis (µs) and the real DEER trace $V(t)$.
- **`r`** — distance grid (nm). `None` uses [`default_r_axis()`](#default_r_axis)
  (1.5–8 nm, 200 points).
- **`bg_start`, `bg_end`** — background-fit window (µs). `bg_start=None` defaults
  to the midpoint of the trace; `bg_end=None` fits to the end. See
  [`background_fit()`](#background_fit). (With `engine='joint'` these only seed
  the initial background guess — the joint fit uses the whole trace.)
- **`dim`, `fit_dim`** — fractal background dimension (3 = homogeneous 3D); set
  `fit_dim=True` to float it.
- **`alpha`** — regularization weight. `None` selects it automatically by `method`.
- **`alpha_factor`** — multiplier applied to the *auto-selected* $\alpha$ (ignored
  when an explicit `alpha` is given). GCV (and AIC) tend to under-regularize the
  near-vertical DEER L-curve, leaving noise spikes in $P(r)$; a factor of 2–4
  reproduces the heavier hand-picked L-corner regularization used to obtain smooth
  distributions in inter-laboratory ring tests
  ([Schiemann et al., *JACS* **2021**, 143, 17875](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c07371)).
- **`alphas`** — the regularization scan grid (default `np.logspace(-4, 3, 36)`).
- **`reg_order`** — derivative order of the smoothing operator $L$ (default 2).
- **`scan_lcurve`** — when `True` (default) the regularization scan is always
  computed for display, even if an explicit `alpha` is given.
- **`method`** — automatic-$\alpha$ criterion: `'gcv'` (default — generalized
  cross-validation, robust) or `'curvature'` (classic maximum-Menger-curvature
  L-corner). See [`l_curve()`](#l_curve).
- **`engine`** — how the background is handled: `'sequential'` (default; fit the
  tail, divide it out, then invert) or `'joint'` (fit background + modulation
  depth together with $P(r)$ in one pass — see
  [`deer_invert_joint()`](#deer_invert_joint)). The joint engine is more robust
  when the background window is short or hard to place.

```python
import numpy as np
import atomize.math_modules.deer as deer

# synthetic 3.5 nm trace
r = deer.default_r_axis(2.0, 5.0, 150)
P = np.exp(-(r - 3.5)**2 / (2*0.15**2))

print(f"lambda = {res['lambda']:.3f}, alpha = {res['alpha']:.3g}, peak r = {peak:.2f} nm")
```

## deer_invert_joint() { #deer_invert_joint data-toc-label="deer_invert_joint" }

```python
res = deer.deer_invert_joint(t, V, r=None, bg_start=None, bg_end=None,
                             dim=3.0, fit_dim=False, alpha=None, alphas=None,
                             reg_order=2, nu_dd=deer.NU_DD, method='gcv',
                             scan_lcurve=True, alpha_factor=1.0)
```

DEER inversion with a **joint** (separable-NLLS / variable-projection) fit of the
background and modulation depth *together* with the regularized non-negative
$P(r)$ — the strategy DeerLab uses. More robust than the sequential
[`deer_invert()`](#deer_invert) pipeline on real traces with short or shallow
backgrounds, where the tail fit and the inversion are coupled. Also reachable as
`deer.deer_invert(..., engine='joint')`.

Starting from the full model

$$
V(t) = B(t)\,\big[(1-\lambda) + \lambda\,(K P)(t)\big],\qquad
B(t) = e^{-(k|t|)^{d/3}},
$$

the substitution $\tilde P = \lambda P$ and $K'(t,r) = K(t,r) - 1$ (note
$K(0,r)=1$) makes the linear part free of $\lambda$:

$$
V/B - 1 = K'\,\tilde P,\qquad \lambda = \textstyle\sum \tilde P,\quad
P = \tilde P/\lambda .
$$

So only the background ($k$, and $d$ when `fit_dim=True`) is nonlinear. For each
trial background the optimal $\tilde P \ge 0$ is the regularized NNLS solution of
the V-space-weighted system $\operatorname{diag}(B)\,K'\,\tilde P = V - B$ (which
down-weights the noisy long-$t$ tail), and the V-space residual is minimized over
$(k[, d])$ with `scipy.optimize.least_squares`. Because $K'$ is constant, $\alpha$
(GCV by default) is stable across the search and is re-selected once at the
converged background.

`bg_start`/`bg_end` only **seed** the initial background guess here; the joint
fit uses the whole trace. Returns the same dict as
[`deer_invert()`](#deer_invert), with `engine='joint'`.

## deer_validate() { #deer_validate data-toc-label="deer_validate" }

```python
val = deer.deer_validate(t, V, r=None, bg_start=None, bg_starts=None,
                         bg_end=None, dim=3.0, fit_dim=False, alpha=None,
                         alpha_factor=1.0, reg_order=2, nu_dd=deer.NU_DD,
                         method='gcv', engine='sequential',
                         noise=0.0, n_noise=0, seed=0, percentiles=(5, 95))
```

**Validation by ensemble averaging**, in the style of the DeerAnalysis validation
tool. The regularization weight is selected **once** on the central trace (honouring
`alpha` / `alpha_factor`) and then held **fixed**, while the inversion is re-run
over a sweep of background-start times (and, optionally, added-noise
realizations). The ensemble of $P(r)$ is collapsed to a **median consensus curve**
plus a percentile **uncertainty band**.

A single GCV inversion of a noisy DEER trace leaves a spiky comb-like $P(r)$;
averaging across background choices suppresses those noise-driven spikes and yields
the smooth, banded distribution familiar from inter-laboratory ring tests
([Schiemann et al., *JACS* **2021**, 143, 17875](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c07371),
Fig. 4). Holding $\alpha$ fixed is both physically correct — validation probes
*background/noise sensitivity*, not the regularization choice — and what keeps it
fast (no per-trial L-curve scan).

- **`bg_start`** — centre of the default background-start sweep (µs). `None` uses
  the trace midpoint.
- **`bg_starts`** — explicit sweep of background-start times. `None` builds a
  9-point grid spanning $\pm 7.5\%$ of the trace length around `bg_start`.
- **`alpha`, `alpha_factor`** — passed to [`deer_invert()`](#deer_invert) for the
  one-off $\alpha$ selection on the central trace; the result is then fixed.
- **`noise`, `n_noise`** — when both are positive, each background-start trial is
  repeated with `n_noise` Gaussian-noise realizations of standard deviation `noise`
  added to $V$ (estimate `noise` from the trace residual).
- **`engine`** — `'sequential'` or `'joint'`, as in [`deer_invert()`](#deer_invert).
- **`percentiles`** — the lower/upper percentiles of the band (default 5–95%).

Returns a dict:

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `r` | The distance axis |
| `P_density` | **Median** $P(r)$ density across the ensemble (the consensus curve — plot this) |
| `P_mean` | Ensemble-mean density (for reference) |
| `P_lower`, `P_upper` | The `percentiles` band (shade between these) |
| `ensemble` | All `n_trials` × `len(r)` trial densities |
| `n_trials` | Number of successful trials |
| `bg_starts` | The background-start grid that was swept |
| `alpha` | The fixed regularization weight |
| `peak`, `r_mean` | Peak position and first moment of the consensus curve |
| `base` | The single central inversion (its `form_factor` / `F_fit` / `background` / `l_curve`, for display) |

```python
val = deer.deer_validate(t, V, r=r, bg_start=1.0, alpha_factor=2.0)
print(f"peak r = {val['peak']:.2f} nm  over {val['n_trials']} trials")
# plot the band:  fill_between(val['r'], val['P_lower'], val['P_upper'])
#         median:  plot(val['r'], val['P_density'])
```

In the Data Treatment GUI this is the **"Validate (background sweep → P(r) band)"**
checkbox on the DEER / PDS tab; the distance view then shows the median curve over
its shaded band.

## dipolar_kernel() { #dipolar_kernel data-toc-label="dipolar_kernel" }

```python
K = deer.dipolar_kernel(t, r, nu_dd=deer.NU_DD)
```

Orientation-averaged DEER kernel (no background, no modulation), shape
`(len(t), len(r))` with $K(0, r) = 1$. Evaluated in closed form via Fresnel
integrals:

$$
K(t, r) = \sqrt{\tfrac{\pi}{6a}}\,\big[\cos(a)\,C(z) + \sin(a)\,S(z)\big],\quad
a = \omega(r)\,|t|,\quad z = \sqrt{6a/\pi}.
$$

---

## dipolar_frequency() { #dipolar_frequency data-toc-label="dipolar_frequency" }

```python
nu = deer.dipolar_frequency(r, nu_dd=deer.NU_DD)
```

Perpendicular dipolar frequency $\nu_\perp(r) = \nu_{dd}/r^3$ [MHz], `r` in nm.

---

## background_fit() { #background_fit data-toc-label="background_fit" }

```python
bg = deer.background_fit(t, V, bg_start, bg_end=None, dim=3.0, fit_dim=False)
```

Fits the intermolecular background on the window $\text{bg\_start} \le t \le
\text{bg\_end}$ and returns the background-corrected form factor. $V$ is
normalized so $V(0) = 1$; the tail window is fit to
$(1-\lambda)\,e^{-(k|t|)^{d/3}}$ with modulation depth $\lambda = 1 - A$, and

$$
B(t) = e^{-(k|t|)^{d/3}}, \qquad F(t) = \frac{V(t)/B(t) - (1-\lambda)}{\lambda}.
$$

Only the **fit window** is bounded by `[bg_start, bg_end]`; $B(t)$ and $F(t)$ are
still evaluated over the whole trace. `bg_end=None` uses everything past
`bg_start`.

Returns a dict with `lambda`, `k`, `dim`, `A`, `B`, `form_factor`, `V_norm`,
`t`, `bg_start`, `bg_end`, and the boolean `mask` of the fit window.

---

## tikhonov_nnls() { #tikhonov_nnls data-toc-label="tikhonov_nnls" }

```python
P = deer.tikhonov_nnls(K, F, alpha, L=None)
```

Non-negative Tikhonov solution of $K P = F$: minimizes
$\lVert K P - F \rVert^2 + \alpha^2 \lVert L P \rVert^2$ subject to $P \ge 0$ by
solving the augmented NNLS problem $[\,K;\ \alpha L\,]\,P = [\,F;\ 0\,]$. `L`
defaults to the 2nd-derivative operator from
[`regularization_matrix()`](#regularization_matrix). Returns the masses
$P \ge 0$.

---

## regularization_matrix() { #regularization_matrix data-toc-label="regularization_matrix" }

```python
L = deer.regularization_matrix(n, order=2)
```

Discrete derivative operator $L$ for Tikhonov smoothing. `order=0` → identity,
`1` → first difference, `2` → second difference (curvature, the default).

---

## l_curve() { #l_curve data-toc-label="l_curve" }

```python
lc = deer.l_curve(K, F, alphas, L=None, method='gcv')
```

Regularization scan over `alphas`: for each one solves the NNLS-Tikhonov problem
and records the residual norm `rho`, the roughness norm `eta`, the Menger L-curve
`curvature`, and the `gcv` score. The optimum is chosen by `method`:

- **`'gcv'`** (default) — minimum of the generalized cross-validation score.
  Robust for DEER, whose L-curve is nearly *vertical* (the residual stays at the
  noise floor across decades of $\alpha$), so the classic corner is ill-defined
  and tends to pick a tiny $\alpha$ ⇒ spiky $P(r)$. GCV uses the (unconstrained)
  Tikhonov influence-matrix trace as the effective degrees of freedom paired with
  the NNLS residual.
- **`'curvature'`** — classic maximum-Menger-curvature L-corner.

Returns a dict with `alphas`, `rho` (residual norms), `eta` (solution norms),
`curvature`, `gcv`, `alpha_opt`, `index`, `method`, and `P` (the solution at the
chosen $\alpha$).

---

## default_r_axis() { #default_r_axis data-toc-label="default_r_axis" }

```python
r = deer.default_r_axis(rmin=1.5, rmax=8.0, n=200)
```

Returns a linear distance grid (nm).

---

## simulate() { #simulate data-toc-label="simulate" }

```python
V = deer.simulate(t, r, P, lam=0.3, k=0.05, dim=3.0,
                  nu_dd=deer.NU_DD, noise=0.0, seed=None)
```

Forward-simulates a DEER trace from a distance distribution $P(r)$:

$$
V(t) = \big[(1-\lambda) + \lambda\,(K P_\text{masses})\big]\,e^{-(k|t|)^{d/3}}
\ (+\ \text{Gaussian noise}).
$$

`t` in µs, `r` in nm; returns $V(t)$ with $V(0) = 1$ (noise aside). Handy for
validating the inversion round-trip and for tests.

---

## NU_DD { #nu_dd data-toc-label="NU_DD" }

Module constant — the perpendicular dipolar frequency constant
$\nu_{dd} = 52.04\ \text{MHz·nm}^3$ (for $g = 2.0023$), so that
$\nu_\perp(r) = \nu_{dd}/r^3$. Override it via the `nu_dd` argument of the
kernel / simulate / invert functions for other $g$-values.
